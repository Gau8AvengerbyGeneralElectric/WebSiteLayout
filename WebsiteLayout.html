	<article><h2>Fact about Sunsets</h2><p>No two sunsets are alike, and part of that is due to ever-changing weather systems.

"Summer and winter sunrises and sunsets function the same way but the way in which we see them differ greatly," Weather Network meteorologist Dayna Vettese said in 2016.

"In the summer, dramatic thunderstorms can be lit up in brilliant sunset colours and create a beautiful scene. In the winter, snow squalls can be lit up by the setting sun. In the summer, there tends to be a more muted tone to sunrise and sunset due to the existence of more moisture and pollution. In the winter, we tend to see more vibrant sunrises and sunsets due to drier and clearer air."</p></article>

	<article><h2>Sample Myth of the Sun</h2><p>
In Norse mythology, Sol and Mani were the Sun and Moon, or more precisely, the beings who drove the Sun and Moon in their courses through the sky. Sol and Mani were sister and brother, and both were fair and beautiful.</p></article>
	
	<article><h2>Etymology</h2><p>Etymology. From Middle English son-sett, Sonne set, equivalent to sun +â€Ž set. In Gower's Confessio Amantis, before 1393.</p></article>
